# GP2040-CE Vendor Toolkit

This program includes tools for vendors creating GP2040-CE controllers. Current list of tools include:

- [x] Board Config Generator
- [ ] Input Tester

This app was made with the [Electron-React-Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com).

## Board Config Generator

This tool generates a BoardConfig.h file that can then be compiled into a firmware file for a custom board.

## Input Tester

This tool (will) test to see if all inputs are in working order and if they need debugging.
